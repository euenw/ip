## Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot (IDE autocomplete)

## Where AI Assisted

### JavaDoc Comments
Copilot helped generate boilerplate Javadoc for public methods and classes,
which were then reviewed and adjusted manually.

### FXML Boilerplate
The repetitive FXML layout files (`MainWindow.fxml`, `DialogBox.fxml`) were
scaffolded with Copilot suggestions, following the SE-EDU JavaFX tutorial
structure.

### CheckStyle Fixes
Copilot suggested fixes for CheckStyle violations (e.g. missing Javadoc,
line length) which sped up the process of resolving them one by one.

### Gradle Configuration
The cross-platform JavaFX dependency block in `build.gradle` (12 lines of
nearly identical dependency declarations) was autocompleted by Copilot.
